# crazyflie-scripts

**WARNING: Research code!**

This repository contains (mostly Python) scripts, instructions, and other resources we create as we experiment with the Bitcraze Crazyflie platform for our research, building applications with indoor drones as user interfaces.

These are primarily intended to serve students and collaborators that work with us.

Third parties should be aware that everything in this repository is experimental.

## Integrations and Instructions

We integrate the following technologies with the Crazyflie in our experiments:

- [Bitalino](https://bitalino.com/) biosignals acquisition platform
- [Qualisys](http://qualisys.com/) motion capture systems

Platform-specific instructions follow.

### Qualisys Motion Capture

- Active marker deck is recommended.
